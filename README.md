# Google Software Product Sprint

This repo contains the projects you'll work on throughout SPS.

To get started:

- Login to [Google Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor)

- Clone this repo: `cd; git clone https://github.com/athankso60/SPS-Team-15-Project.git`

- I deleted the walkthroughs, and we'll be using the portfolio dir as our starter code.

You're all set!
